Analysis of Motorcycle Sales in eBay

Data Analysis and Visualization

This Project will use information regarding the sales of motorcycles through eBay over two years. My goal in this project is to demonstrate practical skills in data manipulation and visualization. I will determine shares of total sales for various brands, track the most popular model for each brand, determine the average, lowest, and highest sales amount for each model. I will also use plot.ly in order to create graphs and charts to reflect this information. 

I will make use of the CSV included in this repo

STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH
1. Import neccesary packages
2. Import CSV as database. 
3. Show iniitial database. 
4. Show cleaned data. 
5. Use SQL and Pandas to aggregate data. 
6. Use Plot.ly to visualize data
